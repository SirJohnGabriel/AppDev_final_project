# Message.io 

## Description

The following code is a simple website to replicate Facebook Messenger but lighter. It is a simple straightforward approach to chats as it can possibly be. It has a functionality to create a new user, login, send images, send chats, and updates real-time as well without using any webhooks for its real-time updates. It also stores the chats and loads it once you login the next time.

Developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript only.
